This is a lightweight, beginner friendly web server written in pure rust (the HTML file included is just an example use case). It listens for HTTP requests, serves static files from
the /public directory, and prints request logs to the terminal. The program is written in Rust's standard library.

Feel free to clone this repo and try it out for yourself!
